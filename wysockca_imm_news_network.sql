The store, located at the corners of California and Battery in the city’s financial district, is modeled much like the five existing locations. It largely serves prepared food, snacks, and drinks, with a focus on Amazon’s own line of sandwiches, salads, and meal kits. But the big innovation is its complete removal of the checkout process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Instead of standing in line and paying a cashier, cameras and sensors track your movements through the store after you’ve scanned your Amazon account at the front. The system, which also uses computer vision and other artificial intelligence-assisted techniques, monitors when you take items off shelves. When you go to leave, you simply walk out, and you’re then charged for what you’ve taken and given a digital receipt through Amazon’s standalone Go app. I took a tour of the 2,300-square-foot location late last week, when its windows were covered and its existence largely a secret until the <em>San Francisco Chronicle</em> <a href=\"https://www.sfchronicle.com/business/article/SF-s-first-Amazon-s-Go-store-approved-for-13318550.php#photo-14553186\">revealed the address on Thursday using property records</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The interior is that of a very nice convenience store, with some seating and microwaves up front for warming up frozen pre-made food and eating in if you so choose. As for checkout, everything worked as advertised. I used the Amazon Go app to walk through a set of automated doors near the front, and from there I picked up an Amazon-made chicken bánh mì sandwich and walked right back out without any hassle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/K30qD4PQP8dRuDB4yWHmy-yDE68=/0x0:2040x1360/1320x0/filters:focal(0x0:2040x1360):format(webp):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13315639/nstatt_181019_3042_8773.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The store’s motto is “Good Food Fast,” and the app even tracks how long you spent during each visit as a kind of brag about the efficiency of the cashier-less model. Dilip Kumar, Amazon’s vice president of technology for Amazon Go, told me that the core focus of the Go model is to save people time. “How crowded [the store] is becomes no longer a function of how long it’s going to take,” Kumar told me. With Go stores, the company wants to eliminate the concept of a morning or lunch rush, as well as the notion that you have to restrict what you buy and where you eat based on how much time you have to wait in line, place an order, and wait for it to be prepared. The store’s hours are 7AM to 9PM local time, and it will be open Monday through Friday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It’s clear from the layout of the store and its upscale presentation that, at least in San Francisco, Amazon is aggressively targeting delis, cafes, casual lunch spots, and drug stores with its Go model. Stocked at the California Street location is pretty much everything you’d find at a 7-Eleven, with a small and seemingly hand-picked selection of goods you might more readily find at, say, a Walgreens. For instance, you can head to the Go store to purchase a can of Pringles, or maybe some chapstick, and choose from a pretty basic selection of cold medicine. You can also buy bread, milk, and cheese.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the focus is more on the fresh food. The quality and selection of the ready-to-eat food is designed to be wide-ranging and competitive with the lunch selection in a downtown urban center. Amazon has a staff of workers and a full offsite kitchen, and each day it makes fresh items that you might be willing to pay made-to-order prices for. That includes sushi, breakfast burritos, salads, and an assortment of sandwiches, among other snacks, candy, and desserts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The company has stocked the store with more expensive <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/18/15988408/amazon-prepackaged-meal-kits-on-sale-fresh-prime-blue-apron\">ready-to-cook kits from its Blue Apron-style meal service</a>, which were restricted to online ordering until the launch of the first Go store in late 2016. Amazon has also partnered with local third-party restaurants, including bakery La Boulangerie and South Indian restaurant chain Dosa, to flesh out its inventory with pastries, yogurts, hummus, and other options. It even partnered with a local chocolate maker to make a San Francisco-centric brand of Amazon Go chocolate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ultimately, Amazon hopes its cashier-less model proves convenient enough, and its food and product selection appealing enough, to draw people away from the tried-and-true chains we’ve become accustomed to. The company is not necessarily trying to replace the 7-Elevens and Walgreens of the world, at least not yet. And a Go store is a far cry from a fast casual restaurant or a traditional restaurant with counter service. Rather, right now it seems like Go stores are an avenue for Amazon to establish a stronger foothold in offline retail, just like its <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/4/14173514/amazon-books-physical-store-new-york-city-columbus-circle-2017\">physical bookstores in Seattle and New York City</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/16/15816174/amazon-whole-foods-acquisition-supermarket-stores\">its acquired Whole Foods locations</a> give it a strategic footprint in groceries and paper books.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vV2QdRl7_2v5eqzJL4-dvBjj3E4=/0x0:2040x1360/1320x0/filters:focal(0x0:2040x1360):format(webp):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13315627/nstatt_181019_3042_8734.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, down the line, Amazon could use its Go model as a way to aggressively expand its brick-and-mortar operation if the stores prove especially successful and capable of handling high volumes of shoppers. <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-09-19/amazon-is-said-to-plan-up-to-3-000-cashierless-stores-by-2021\"><em>Bloomberg</em> reported in September</a> that the company plans to open thousands of locations over the next three years in what would be a remarkable escalation of Amazon’s offline retail rivalry with Walmart, grocery chains, and even the traditional restaurant and fast food industries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We’re not quite there yet. But Amazon is starting to move faster, and in the process its transforming from an e-commerce giant to a true, do-everything retail operation. The company has already planned its second San Francisco location at a site basically around the corner from its current one, at 98 Post Street. It will be slightly smaller than the first one, and it’s opening this winter, the company says. Meanwhile, in Chicago, Amazon is opening its third Go store at the Illinois Center in 2019. That will bring is total number of stores up to eight, with at least one location planned for New York City some time in the next year.</p>\r\n\r\n', 'Amazon’s latest experimental Go convenience store is opening today in San Francisco, adding the Bay Area city as the third after Chicago and Seattle in the company’s ongoing offline retail expansion.', 'https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/23/18010022/amazon-go-cashier-less-store-san-francisco-location-opens', 'tech', ''),
(6, 'James Lewis', 'Picking the Right Arduino', '1_BGyiMUfJivWNMA8MXnPHuA.jpeg', '<p>My introduction to the Arduino happened when there were two options: the Duemilanove and the Mega. The only decision involved the number of I/O pins. Almost ten years later, there is an Arduino board type for (practically) every application or project. The choice can be overwhelming when selecting. Here are some considerations for the major types.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>What Is Arduino?</h2>\r\n<p>Arduino is an open source hardware platform. There are two elements to the name: the boards and the software. Only boards from Arduino.cc can officially be called an “Arduino.” (The name is trademarked.) From an open source perspective, as Arduino grew in popularity the Software, or Integrated Development Environment (IDE), has been expanded to support many other boards. These devices are more correctly called “Arduino compatibles.”</p>\r\n\r\n<figure>\r\n  <pre>\r\n    <code>\r\n      int digitalRead(uint8_t pin) {\r\n        uint8_t timer = digitalPinToTimer(pin);\r\n        uint8_t bit = digitalPinToBitMask(pin);\r\n        uint8_t port = digitalPinToPort(pin);\r\n\r\n      if (port == NOT_A_PIN)\r\n          return LOW;\r\n        if (timer != NOT_ON_TIMER) \r\n          turnOffPWM(timer);\r\n        if (*portInputRegister(port) & bit) \r\n          return HIGH;\r\n\r\n      return LOW;\r\n      }\r\n    </code>\r\n  </pre>\r\n</figure>\r\n\r\n<p>On the software side, there is the “core” and the “IDE.” The core is a C++ library called the “Arduino core,” which is unique for each processor type. This (extensive) library allows common functions like digitalRead() or digitalWrite() to work on so many different architectures. The IDE is a cross-platform application that provides a clear starting point for all things Arduino.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the hardware side, it is difficult to summarize ALL possible variations succinctly. So the focus here is on these popular styles: Uno, Mega, ESP8266, Zero, and MKR. Even within these, there are variants, some of which I mention below. First, let’s look at a specification based decision.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>8-Bit vs. 32-Bit War Continues</h2>\r\n<p>Unlike early video game consoles, picking a processor is not as simple as the bit number. In general, 8-bit processors offer basic capabilities while consuming lower power. The simpler architectures mean directly programming registers tend to be relatively easy. 32-bit processors offer higher clock speeds along with more RAM, ROM, and serial peripherals. Their architectures could make programming more complicated. Fortunately, frameworks like the Arduino library and CircuitPython hide much of that complexity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Choosing a microprocessor just because it is 8-bit or 32-bit can be short-sighted. So it is essential to think about how you plan to use it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*Ww2incXkvuwiDLt1liLSEQ.jpeg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>8-Bit: Uno, Nano, and Mega</h2>\r\n<p>The Uno is the favored starting point for Arduino projects. It has a distinctive shape with a pseudo-standard header pinout. Its CPU is Microchip’s ATmega328P. This processor’s most overlooked specification is the 2,048 bytes of RAM. The Uno is a lousy choice if you are thinking about sending, receiving, or processing strings. Outside of strings, you would be surprised what you can do with so little, especially given the number of GPIO available.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Nano</h3>\r\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*9oyhpLhxFcZXoTc2Zkyuag.jpeg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If the Uno is too large, consider the Nano. It’s the most copied, or cloned, Arduino variant. It is the same processor as the Uno, but the board is a slimmed down form factor. The direct software capability means you can prototype with an Uno and install a Nano in your final project.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Mega</h3>\r\n<p>If the Uno (or Nano) do not offer enough I/O or RAM, boards based on the ATmega2560 are an option. The Mega-boards are exceptionally popular in motor control applications, like 3D printers. While their cores are common, compared to the ATmega328p, the ATmega2560 has more timers, a second ADC, additional hardware UARTs, and a ton more I/O pins. However, it is still an 8-bit processor like the Uno.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>USB with 32U4</h3>\r\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*8zsNWazJ-NOd3JV4M_ESvg.jpeg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another variation of the Uno is the Leonardo or Micro. These boards use the ATmega32U4 chip. Unlike the other 8-bit boards mentioned here, the processor has a built-in USB interface. This feature makes it very simple to create USB keyboards, mice, and joysticks. A popular compatible board is the Teensy LC from PRJC. It is the same 32U4 but in a teensy-sized form factor.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>32-Bit</h2>\r\n<p>Side note: I am referring to 32-bit microcontrollers which are not running an operating system. So I am not comparing Arduino to Raspberry Pi or BeagleBone-like boards.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Arduino Zero</h3>\r\n<p>The Arduino Zero contains a 32-bit Microchip SAM D21, which is built around an Arm Cortex-M0+. The board shares the same pinout and form factor as the Uno, yet the processor is entirely different.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In general, the 8-bit boards are based on a 5 volt rail while the 32-bit boards are based on a 3.3 volt rail. It is important to know that most 3.3 volt processors cannot tolerate 5 volt signals. So you may need to use level-shifters when interfacing between the two voltage levels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*PTo1hN6mneTiymRi3oJfbg.jpeg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The most striking feature of the M0+ boards is the incredibly flexible serial interfaces. While the boards define I²C and SPI pins, the chip itself is highly configurable. It supports multiple types of serial interfaces on multiple I/O pins.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Like its 8-bit cousin, the Zero comes in smaller form factors.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>MKR Series</h3>\r\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*siF_QW8TyxKndm3YNcdJeg.jpeg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Arduino MKR series includes boards such as the MKR ZERO, MKR GSM 1400, MKR FOX 1200, and the MKR WiFi 1010. The form factor of the boards in the MKR series is similar. Their I/O pins run down the sides, the form factor is slimmed down, and they all contain a LiPo battery connector with charger circuit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The MKR Zero includes the same processor as the Zero. In addition to the slimmer form factor and LiPo charger, the MKR Zero adds a MicroSD card slot.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*kkd4xbqoFAF58VULyRlGrg.jpeg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>One other board to mention is the MKR WiFi 1010. This board is relatively new and contains a chip dedicated to crypto communication. The other exciting feature of the MKR1010 is its processor(s) choice. Onboard there is the same SAMD21 found on the Zero. However, the WiFi module from u-blox includes an ESP32. It is two processors in one.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lastly, there are shields designed for the MKR form factor. They add serial busses like RS-485 and CAN, among other features.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>ESP8266 and ESP32</h3>\r\n<p>When the ESP8266 hit the market, it changed how projects incorporate WiFi. This system on a chip is a 32-bit microcontroller running at 80 MHz with a chip dedicated to WiFi operation. Which means, it runs the full TCP/IP stack separate from the microcontroller running your code.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ESP modules contain a full microcontroller in their SoC package. The core Arduino library has been ported to the ESP12 and ESP32, meaning in some cases code for an Uno compiles for the ESP12 without any changes!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*GCeKJFtwLcDO17iQN7dGag.jpeg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The picture above shows 4 different ESP options. A barebones ESP8266, Adafruit’s Huzzah ESP8266, an Adafruit Feather ESP32, and a ESP8266 NodeMCU. The barebones board was popular because of cost, but it requires extra components to be useful. The Huzzah ESP8266 adds some of those parts and breaks out more of the I/O pins. However, it still requires a serial-to-USB adapter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Adafruit’s Feather form factor adds serial-to-USB and a LiPo charger to the ESP8266 or ESP32. It makes working with the ESP very easy. You might notice the Feather looks like the MKR. Sadly, while they are visually similar, they are different sizes and do not have a common pinout.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lastly is the NodeMCU form factor which is not a form factor! NodeMCU is a firmware that runs a Lua script interpreter on the ESP8266. It can be replaced with an Arduino bootloader. Once replaced, you can program the board with the Arduino IDE.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When you need to add WiFi to a project, ESP-based boards are an excellent starting point.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Which Arduino Is the Best?</h2>\r\n<p>You might still be wondering: which one of these boards is the best Arduino?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As you can see, each of these different boards has some advantages for different situations. The question “which Arduino board is best” is not a complete question. You need to fill in the question with “… for my application or project.”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While it is not possible to cover every board type and variant, this information should give you enough context to consider a board for your project. If not, leave a response and let’s find the best Arduino (or Arduino-compatible) for you.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n', 'My introduction to the Arduino happened when there were two options: the Duemilanove and the Mega.

But that doesn’t necessarily mean that the general public knows what makes an app, well, an app.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over the years, I’ve encountered several small business owners who declared that they needed a mobile app. They were under the impression that an app should be there to live alongside their website and cater to the needs of mobile users.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Usually, after a bit of investigation, it turns out than an app wasn’t necessary at all. In reality, a well-designed <a href=\"https://speckyboy.com/free-responsive-html5-web-templates/\">responsive</a> website will often cover all the basics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still, the confusion remains. It begs the questions: What are the downsides to having an app? How do we explain the situation to clients? Finally, when should an app be a realistic part of the discussion?</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Apps Aren’t Always the Answer</h2>\r\n<p>Thanks to the likes of <a href=\"https://speckyboy.com/improving-rank-ios-app-store/\">Apple</a> and Google, apps are often seen as being glamorous or a status symbol. And it makes sense that business owners want to be in this exclusive club (that boasts millions of other members, notwithstanding).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But before you even decide if a client really needs to have an app, consider the following:</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Phone Space is Super Competitive</h3>\r\n<p>While high-end products like the iPhone or Samsung Galaxy are heavily used, not everyone has that sort of buying power. Many consumers are relegated to low-and-mid-range models. One of the biggest differences between these categories is storage capacity. Users of cheaper phones are usually quite squeezed for space.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The result is that only the “essential” apps get installed. <a href=\"https://speckyboy.com/social-selling-startup-guide/\">Social media</a>, productivity and <a href=\"https://speckyboy.com/retro-video-games-html5-js-css/\">games</a> are where users are opting to spend their limited storage. If you’re banking on wide usage of your app, it had better be worth it to the end user.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>It Can Be Expensive</h3>\r\n<p>The other side of the coin (literally) is that having a mobile app developed and maintained will cost you. For a small business, this can really cut into a marketing budget. If your app is superfluous, this takes precious funds away from more pressing matters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://speckyboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/small-business-mobile-app-03.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Discussing Mobile Apps with Clients</h2>\r\n<p>When a client brings up the possibility of a mobile app, it’s our job to find out all we can about their potential needs. Whether app development is part of your services list or <a href=\"https://speckyboy.com/web-design-third-party-services/\">not</a>, you’ll want to try and guide them in the right direction.<p>\r\n\r\n<p>Too often, we see people go into sales mode. But in this case our clients need us to be an honest broker. That certainly doesn’t mean we can’t sell them on what we have to offer. It just means that we should only sell them what they need.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To find out whether an app makes sense, start out by asking the following <a href=\"https://speckyboy.com/questions-client-freelancer/\">questions</a>:</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What do you want the app to accomplish?</h3>\r\n<p>The client should at least have a somewhat clear goal for what their app would do. That could be anything from increasing sales to helping visitors find their way at an event.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Who is your ideal user?</h3>\r\n<p>In other words, we want to find out the app’s potential target market. However, the focus may be a bit narrower in terms of who might use it. For instance, a business may have at least some clientele who aren’t tech-savvy. This group may not get much use out of an app.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Why can’t (or shouldn’t) the website do this?</h3>\r\n<p>This is where we get the details that will help determine whether or not an app is needed. It’s about functionality, problem-solving and marketing. An app will show its true potential when we analyze what it will do as compared to the existing website.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://speckyboy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/small-business-mobile-app-02.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>So, When Does an App Make Sense?</h2>\r\n<p>Once we have the right information, we can then figure out whether a mobile app might be beneficial. As a primer, let’s look at some scenarios where an app could make sense:</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>It Takes Advantage of Smartphone Technology</h3>\r\n<p>One of the greatest attributes of a well-made and useful mobile app is that it makes use of device technology. For example, think about apps that utilize GPS or the built-in camera. They often help users find a specific location or document something. The need for this functionality may rule out depending on a responsive website alone to serve the mobile crowd.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>It Makes a Task Easier for Users</h3>\r\n<p>This is the value proposition for an app. Why should someone take the time to install it on their device? If it helps them perform tasks more efficiently than a website, then it could be just what the doctor ordered.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>It Has a Chance to Meet the Expected Demand</h3>\r\n<p>Even if this amazing app makes good use of technology and is helpful, it has to have a solid user base in order to be worth the money. This can be tricky to figure out. But it’s helpful to think about the client’s business in general. Look at customer demographics and how likely they are to use an app. Also look at potential ways the app could attract new customers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If the app has a reasonable chance to find a solid group of core users, it could be a great investment for the business.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Clearing Up Mobile Confusion</h2>\r\n<p>In the last decade, smartphones and tablets have become go-to devices for so many. But it’s important to remember that not everyone recognizes the difference between a dedicated mobile app and a mobile-friendly website. To a lot of end users, the lines are still blurred.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As web professionals, we can help by making our clients aware of that distinction. From there, we can dig a little deeper to find out what they <a href=\"https://speckyboy.com/what-a-client-really-needs/\">really need</a>. That may well turn out to be an app. But it could be that their website already has what they were looking for all along.</p>', 'Mobile apps have been around for over a decade now.

Are some people just born great developers or do people become great developers through effort?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I believe that it is impossible to know the true answer to this question so I have chosen to believe that a person becomes a good developer through their efforts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It’s a more useful viewpoint. It means that if I am struggling to learn something, I can learn it if I work hard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It also means that I have to accept that things won’t always be easy or fun. Hard work is required.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>2. When you try to do something for the first time, it might be hard?—?and you’re not supposed to be good at it immediately</h2>\r\n<p>As a programmer, I sometimes find myself feeling frustrated because I run into something I don’t understand and I feel like I should understand it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There was the time when I joined a company that was using git and was surrounded by git experts. There was the time I finally had to face the fact that my SQL skills weren’t very good.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In each of these instances a part of me felt that I should be good at these skills. After all, wasn’t I a senior full-stack engineer with years of experience?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The fact was that although I was an engineer with a lot of experience, no amount of experience could change my reality?—?I was learning the details of these skills for the first time, and at first I wasn’t that good at either of them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although sometimes new things are easy, sometimes they are not. I have found that a useful viewpoint is that when I do something for the first time I am not supposed to be good at it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It goes like this…</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I’ve never programmed in Java before?—?I’m not supposed to be good at it. That’s why I’m taking this class”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>“I’ve never committed code to a git repo before?—?I’m not supposed to know how to do it. That’s why I’m asking my colleague for help”</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This kind of thinking defuses that voice in my head that’s saying I’m no good or I’m going to fail. I very well may fail and I’m probably not good yet. I’m not supposed to be good?—?that’s why I’m giving it a try?—?to get better.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>3. Working on code is not always supposed to be fun, and even though a task is not fun, it can still be done</h2>\r\n<p>Sometimes I run into tasks in software development that are not fun.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some piece of data processing code in my Spark cluster is causing nodes to randomly fail, or some library that should work will not work no matter what I do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These moments are not fun, and sometimes I honestly would rather do anything other than spend my time trying to figure out what’s going on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The thing is, I know that coding is not always supposed to be fun and sometimes I just have to roll up my sleeves and ‘do the work’.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even though times like this can be hard, I’ve found that they usually have a silver lining?—?it turns out that the hard stuff is where we learn the most.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>4. You learn the most when you face the greatest challenges?—?and failure at times like this is normal</h2>\r\n<p>When I challenge myself by trying to do something that is too hard for me, I find that those are the moments when I truly learn.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For me, dozens of examples stand out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There was the first time that I picked up a programming book?—?I struggled until suddenly I had learned to code.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There was the time I was trying to architect larger applications. I struggled until I discovered architectural frameworks and learned about design patterns?—?at which point we threw away months of work on previous code, started over, and rebuilt our app in a few short weeks using the new design patterns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There was the time that I finally buckled down and really learned SQL. After that I had the skills to work with my company’s data science team.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There was the time I tried to architect our company’s data processing infrastructure using web-app technologies. I struggled until I learned about data lakes, ETL pipelines, and distributed computing solutions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The list goes on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each of these experiences had its painful moments. I went down a lot of dead end alleys and threw out a lot of code. I tried a lot of things and I failed, a lot.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But that pressure taught me new skills and made me a better developer. Had it not been for that pressure I never would have learned my lessons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These days I choose to believe that when I am feeling stressed out, struggling, and a bit nervous it is a good thing. I am struggling so I am learning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And…</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I have learned to welcome those nervous feelings. They’re not comfortable but I think the learning is worth it.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The mind is a powerful tool</h2>\r\n<p>You can choose what you believe and your beliefs can give you the grit to push through the challenges you will inevitably face on your path to becoming a better developer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I hope these mental frameworks (or some of your own) are useful for helping you get past your own struggles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Don’t give up. Keep going.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When you don’t understand something, keep working hard and keep trying to understand it. You will be surprised what you are capable of if you just try.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thank you for taking the time to read my article.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you found this article helpful, let me know ???.</p>\r\n\r\nIf you want to read more click the “follow” button below and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/wschlender\">follow me on twitter.</a>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://medium.freecodecamp.org/@walt.schlender\">Follow</a></p>', '<p>The times when I have made the greatest leaps in my development skills have been when I struggled to learn something new and didn’t give up.

These websites are also great places to get free web design templates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is true what they say about having only one chance to make a good first impression. Good website designs can take one’s breath away at first sight. That’s why <a href=\"https://www.mockplus.com/blog/post/homepage-design-tips\">homepage design</a> matters a lot. And when it comes to designing websites, getting the layout perfectly is imperative.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To give you some inspiration and help you along with your next project, the Mockplus team has gathered 9 of the <strong>best website layout examples in 2018</strong>. You will get the most creative website layout ideas from them.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>1. Diker Bau Website</h2>\r\n<p><strong>Website layout idea:</strong> Featured image to display the brand identity</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/0*ouNkLIguB24nYKqv.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Diker</em> is a Group of Construction and Architecture+Planning companies based in Berlin, Germany. The designer outlined the major characteristics and attributes of the brand identity. These were used as the basis for the overall website structure and architecture. Modern coding and testing techniques were used to ensure the usability of the website.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The design is not littered with excess elements, thus directing the user’s attention entirely toward the product.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Images provide an opportunity to create an emotional connection with visitors?—?a big, bold photograph or illustration of an object makes a strong statement and creates a stunning first impression. This layout is great when you need to demonstrate only one product/service and focus a user’s attention on it. If you want to design a site that can sell a product fast, then use this type of layout.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Visit site: <a href=\"https://www.behance.net/gallery/22105949/Diker-Bau-Website\">https://www.behance.net/gallery/22105949/Diker-Bau...</a></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>2. Chekhov</h2>\r\n<p><strong>Website layout idea:</strong> Split screen layout<p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/0*1vJhVchqXXZOFjEK.png\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Chekhov</em> uses a split screen layout, which offers two main pieces of content of equal importance simultaneously. By putting two items side by side, the designer creates contrast, thus attracting more attention. The combination of animation and color changes creates a more dynamic experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If your site needs to offer two drastically different variations of the user journey, then use the split screen layout. But do avoid using too much content in split sections. Split screen designs do not expand as well as content grows, so it’s better to avoid this type of layout if you need to provide a lot of textual or visual information in split sections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Visit site: <a href=\"https://chekhov.withgoogle.com/alive#home\">https://chekhov.withgoogle.com/alive#home</a></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>3. Timothee Roussilhe</h2>\r\n<p><strong>Website layout idea:</strong> Parallax scrolling effect</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/0*2ZMIGlkUnO_TC66M.png\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Time thee Roussilhe</em> is the resume website of designer Timothee Roussilhe. It’s simple yet creative. He adds a parallax effect to provide an impressive experience. As you scroll down, there are boxes moving in and out. What’s amazing is how all the boxes take advantages of the parallax effect; you feel like you are watching a movie while browsing the site.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you want to design a website with cool factors, then use the parallax effect. But remember to keep the layout simple and use a clean color scheme to avoid a messy design.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Visit site: <a href=\"http://timroussilhe.com/\">http://timroussilhe.com/</a></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>4. Happiness Abscissa</h2>\r\n<p><strong>Website layout idea:</strong> Fixed sidebar navigation</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/0*FRRh1k6wJilJi5GY.png\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Happiness Abscissa</em> uses a fixed sidebar navigation to display the whole layout. The main menu is the critical element in user navigation. It tells the user where they are and where they want to go.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Usually, we see a top-side horizontal navigation, but here, we see a vertical column on the left part as the sidebar. The key is to keep the bar visible and accessible while the rest of page changes as users scroll up and down.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This site also uses a parallax effect. As you scroll down, the layout changes and just displays text accompanied by a single decoration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are building a website that contains only a few navigation options, you might want to consider this layout. It can ensure all the options are in-sight as users go through your page. Also, you can add social media links, contact details, or any other information you want to visitors to find easily on the sidebar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Visit site: <a href=\"https://www.happinessabscissa.com/\">https://www.happinessabscissa.com/</a></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>5. Assemble</h2>\r\n<p><strong>Website layout idea:</strong> A grid of cards</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/0*LONoL4dOvWRakIrX.png\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Assemble</em> offers wonderful portfolio projects by using cards in a grid structure. Cards allow you to serve up a heavy dose of clickable information in a digestible manner. It helps visitors find the content they like and provide a way to dive into details by simply clicking or tapping the card.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This layout is also popular in responsive layout design. Grids of cards work excellently with variable elements such as size, spacing, number of columns, and screens?—?with the ability to display a lot of items with equal hierarchy. So, if you have a content-heavy site, a grid of cards is a perfect choice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Visit site: <a href=\"http://assemble.edge-themes.com/landing/\">http://assemble.edge-themes.com/landing/</a></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>6. Medium</h2>\r\n<p><strong>Website layout idea:</strong> Multi-column layout</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/0*Cvi3jetAIAw7q06t.png\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Medium</em> is a popular blogging website which presents huge amounts of information to the reader in an easy-to-follow manner. It uses a multi-column grid to create a complex hierarchy and integrates text and illustrations, making it easier for visitors to scan, read, and understand a page quickly. There is a visual rhythm to allow the eye to travel naturally from one block to another.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This layout is similar to a magazine layout, a good choice for publications that have a complex hierarchy with large amounts of content on a page.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is one thing that makes the design stand out: when you dive into a deeper page, you will see the article page is in the single-column layout. This makes for an effortless read, even for long articles which require you to scroll down.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Visit site: <a href=\"https://medium.com/\">https://medium.com/</a></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>7. Beverages</h2>\r\n<p><strong>Website layout idea:</strong> Boxes?—?large header-width box and a few smaller boxes</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/0*jHqerHanHN7jB9iz.png\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Beverages</em> has layout with a large header-width box; and a few smaller boxes that each take up a portion of the larger box’s screen real estate. The number of smaller boxes can range from two to five. Each of the boxes can be a link that leads to a larger and more complex page.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is a versatile layout that can be used for both <a href=\"https://www.mockplus.com/blog/post/portfolio-design-websites\">individual portfolio-like sites</a> and for corporate/e-commerce websites. You can connect boxes to tell a story. The large box can be used to showcase products while the smaller boxes can offer further information on the product.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Visit site: <a href=\"https://p.w3layouts.com/demos_new/template_demo/07-03-2018/beverages-demo_Free/883271017/web/index.html\">https://p.w3layouts.com/demos_new/template_demo/07-03-2018/beverages-demo_Free/883271017/web/index.html</a></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>8. Casangelina</h2>\r\n<p><strong>Website layout idea:</strong> Asymmetrical layout</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/0*o_2-yvGaOZsmeXd1.png\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Hotel Casangelina</em>, one of the top ten cliff hotels in the world, is located on the cliffs of the Amalfi Coast. This website uses an asymmetrical layout, whth a lack of equality between the two parts of the page. Asymmetry is a long-time favorite technique in the art world; and has recently become popular among web designers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Take note that asymmetry is different from imbalance. The goal of asymmetry is to create a balance when it’s either impossible or undesirable to use equal weight for two sections. Using asymmetry makes it possible to create tension and dynamism. Asymmetry facilitates better scanning behavior by focusing a user’s attention on individual objects (focal points). By changing the width, scale, and color of each asymmetrical piece of content, the designer encourages the visitor to stay visually engaged.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This type of layout can be used when designers want to create interesting and unexpected layouts, while still providing directional emphasis. Appropriately applied, asymmetry can create active space that guides the eye from one element to another, even across emptiness. Consider how Dropbox clearly shows points of focus in the example below.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Make sure your content can be presented in an asymmetrical layout.</strong> An asymmetrical layout is not practical for every site. It works best for minimalist layouts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Add focus with color. Asymmetry is rooted in the idea that an object with more visual weight will draw attention first. You can use elements with high color contrast to add visual weight to specific parts of the design.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Visit site: <a href=\"http://www.casangelina.com/\">http://www.casangelina.com/</a></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>9.

It’s used to introduce visitors to the site content. This layout has an opportunity to create a strong first impression and encourages user interaction</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This layout is great when you want to say less and show more. Since the layout?—?and the message?—?revolves around a single image, it is critical that you use the perfect one. Choose your image carefully to avoid sending the wrong message or confusing visitors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Use videos instead of images to engage visitors. It might be worth using video instead of a photo, especially when you need to demonstrate something in action.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Visit site: <a href=\"https://tinkerwatches.com/\">https://tinkerwatches.com/</a></p>\r\n\r\nThere you have it?—?the 9 best website layout examples we could find.

(9, 'Marina Yalanska', 'UX Design: How to Make Web Interface Scannable', 'ux-design-scannable-interface-tubik-blog-1.png', '<p>The article explains the factor of scannability, eye-tracking patterns and presents 10 tips for UX designers on enhancing scannability of web user interfaces.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Day by day we are overwhelmed with massive information flow both offline and online. Due to new technologies and fast internet connection, people can produce more content than they are physically able to consume. Dealing with numerous websites and apps, users don’t read everything they see word by word – they first scan the page to find out why and how it’s useful for them. So, scannability is one of the essential factors of website usability today. Today’s article explores the phenomenon and gives tips on how to make the digital product scannable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://tubikstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/CTA-button-design-ux-practices-tubik-blog.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>What Is Scannability?</h2>\r\n<p>Applied to a page or screen, the verb “scan” means to glance at/over or read hastily. So, scannability is the way to present the content and navigation elements as the layout that can be scanned easily. Interacting with a website, especially the first time, users quickly look through the content to analyze whether it’s what they need. Any piece of the content may become a hook in this process: words, sentences, images, or animations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By the way, this behavior is nothing new: for many decades, people often do the same with a new magazine or newspaper looking through them before they start attentive reading of the articles. What’s more, reading from the screen is much more tiring than on paper, so users are more selective when and where they are ready to bother.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Why is that important? About a decade ago <a href=\"https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-users-read-on-the-web/\">Jacob Nielsen</a> answered the question “How people read on the Web?” simply: “They don’t. People rarely read Web pages word by word; instead, they scan the page, picking out individual words and sentences”. Since then it hasn’t changed much: we aren’t ready to invest our time and effort into exploring the website if we aren’t sure it corresponds to our needs. So, if an eye has nothing to be caught with at the first minutes of introduction, the risk is high that the user will go away. Whatever is the type of a website, scannability is one of the significant factors of its user-friendly nature.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How can you check if the webpage is scannable? Try to look at it as a first-time user and answer two questions:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>– Does what you see in the first couple of minutes correspond to what target audience expects from this page?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>– Can you understand what kind of information is on the page for the first minute or two?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you aren’t sure that both answers are positive, perhaps it’s time to think how to strengthen the website scannability. It’s worth investing time because well-scanned pages become much more efficient in the following aspects:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>users complete their tasks and achieve their goals quicker</li>\r\n<li>users make fewer mistakes in the search of content they need</li>\r\n<li>users understand the structure and navigation of the website faster</li>\r\n<li>the bounce rate is reduced</li>\r\n<li>the level of retaining users gets higher</li>\r\n<li>the website looks and feels more credible</li>\r\n<li>the SEO rates are affected positively.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://tubikstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/tips-on-visual-hierarchy-in-design.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Popular Scanning Patterns</h2>\r\n<p>The vital thing which interface designer has to consider is eye-scanning patterns that show how users interact with a webpage in the first seconds. When you understand HOW people scan the page or screen, you may prioritize the content and put WHAT users need into the most visible zones. This domain of user research is supported by <a href=\"https://www.nngroup.com/articles/eyetracking-study-of-web-readers/\">Nielsen Norman Group</a> and provides designers and usability specialists with the better understanding of user behavior and interactions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Different experiments collecting data on user eye-tracking have shown that there are several typical models along which visitors usually scan the website.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://tubikstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/z-pattern-web-scannability.png\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Z-Pattern is quite typical for the web pages with the uniform presentation of information and weak visual hierarchy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://tubikstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/zig-zag-pattern-web-scannability.png\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another scheme features zig-zag pattern typical for pages with visually divided content blocks. Again, the reader’s eyes go left to right starting from the upper left corner and moving across all the page to the upper right corner scanning the information in this initial zone of interaction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://tubikstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/f_reading_pattern_eyetracking.jpg\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>One more model is F-pattern presented in the explorations by <a href=\"https://www.nngroup.com/articles/f-shaped-pattern-reading-web-content/\">Nielsen Norman Group</a> and showing that users often demonstrate the following flow of interaction:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Users first read in a horizontal movement, usually across the upper part of the content area. This initial element forms the F’s top bar.</li>\r\n<li>Next, users move down the page a bit and then read across in a second horizontal movement that typically covers a shorter area than the previous movement. This additional element forms the F’s lower bar.</li>\r\n<li>Finally, users scan the content’s left side in a vertical movement. Sometimes this is a fairly slow and systematic scan that appears as a solid stripe on an eye-tracking heatmap. Other times users move faster, creating a spottier heatmap. This last element forms the F’s stem.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>Tips on Improving Scannability</h2>\r\n<h3>1. Prioritize the content with visual hierarchy</h3>\r\n<p>Basically, visual hierarchy is the way to arrange and organize the content on the page in the way which is the most natural for human perception. The main goal behind it is to let users understand the importance level of each piece of content. So, if the visual hierarchy is applied, the users will see the key content first.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, when we see the article in the blog, we’ll get the headline first, then subheadings and only then copy blocks. Does it mean that the information in the copy blocks has the low level of importance? Well, no, but this way users will be able to scan the headline and subheadings to understand if the article is useful and interesting for them instead of trying to read all the text. And if the headline and subheadings are done properly and inform the user about the structure and contents of the article, this will be the factor convincing to read more. On the other hand, if users see the huge and long sheet of text not separated into chunks, they will be literally scared, not able to understand how long it will take to read this article and if it is worth investing their time and effort.<p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are several main factors helping to build up the visual hierarchy:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>size</li>\r\n<li>color</li>\r\n<li>contrast</li>\r\n<li>proximity</li>\r\n<li>negative space</li>\r\n<li>repetition.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>All of them help designers transform the set of elements, links, images and copy into the harmonic scannable system of the page layout.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>2. Put the core navigation into the website header</h3>\r\n<p>All the mentioned eye-scanning patterns show that whichever of them a particular user follows, the scanning process will start in the top horizontal area of the webpage. Using it for showing the key zones of interaction and branding is a strategy supporting both sides. That is the basic reason why website header design is considered as an essential issue by not only UI/UX designers but also content managers and marketing specialists.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the other hand, the header shouldn’t be overloaded: too much information makes it impossible to focus. The attempt to put everything into the top part of the page can transform the layout into the mess. So, in every particular case, it’s a must to analyze the goals of the core target audience, how they cross with the business goals behind the website and based on that – what information or navigation should be put into header as the most important. For example, if it’s a big e-commerce website, search functionality has to be instantly visible and is often found in the header to be accessible from any point of interaction. Whereas for the small corporate website, search functionality can be unnecessary at all but the immediately seen link to the portfolio will be crucial.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://tubikstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/gourmet_website_interactions_tubik.gif\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>3. Keep the balance of negative space</h3>\r\n<p>Negative space — or white space, as it’s often called — is the area of the layout which is left empty, not only around the objects in the layout but also between and inside them. Negative space is a kind of breathing room for all the objects on the page or screen. It defines the limits of objects, creates the necessary bonds between them according to Gestalt principles and builds up effective visual performance. In UI design for websites and mobile apps, negative space is a big factor of high navigability of the interface: without enough air, layout elements aren’t properly seen so users risk missing what they really need. It may be a strong reason for eye and brain tense although many users won’t be able to formulate the problem. A proper amount of negative space, especially micro space, solves it and makes the process more natural.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>4. Check that CTA is seen at once</h3>\r\n<p>Obviously, the vast majority of web pages are aimed at particular actions which users have to complete. The elements that contain the call to action (CTA), usually buttons, should be seen in split seconds to let users understand what actions they can do on this page. Among the good tests is checking the page in the black-and-white and blurred modes. If in both cases you can distinguish CTA elements quickly, they are done well. For example, on the webpage of the <a href=\"https://tubikstudio.com/case-study-vinnys-bakery-ui-design-for-e-commerce/\">bakery website</a> shown below the CTA button of adding the item to the list is easily seen among the other elements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://tubikstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Bakery-website-catalog-design-ui.png\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>5. Test the readability of copy content</h3>\r\n<p>Readability defines how easy people can read words, phrases, and blocks of copy. Legibility measures how quickly and intuitively users can distinguish the letters in a particular typeface. These characteristics should be carefully considered, especially for the interfaces filled with a lot of text. The color of the background, amount of space around copy blocks, kerning, leading, type of font and font pairing – all these factors influence the ability to quickly scan the text and catch the content convincing users to stay. To prevent the problem, designers have to check if the typography laws are followed and whether the chosen fonts support general visual hierarchy and readability. User testing will help to check how quickly and easily users are able to perceive the text.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>6. Apply numbers, not words</h3>\r\n<p>This piece of advice is based on another investigation by <a href=\"https://www.nngroup.com/articles/web-writing-show-numbers-as-numerals/\">Nielsen Norman Blog</a>. They shared an important finding: eye-tracking studies showed that in the process of scanning web pages, numerals often stop the wandering user’s eye and attract fixations, even embedded in a mass of words that would be ignored without numbers. We subconsciously associate numbers with facts, stats, sizes and distance — data which is potentially useful. So numbers included in copy catch reader’s attention while words representing numerals can be missed in the bulk of copy. What’s more, numbers are more compact than the textual numeral, so it makes the content more concise and time-saving for scanning.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>7. Place one idea in one paragraph</h3>\r\n<p>Processing the copy content in the aspect of scannability, try not to make the bulks of text too long. Short paragraphs look more digestible and can be easier skipped in case the information is not valuable for the reader. So, follow the rule when you present one idea in one paragraph and start another one for a new thought.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://tubikstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/tubikstudio-ui-animation-website-design.gif\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<h3>8. Use numbered and bulleted lists</h3>\r\n<p>One more good trick to make the text more scannable is using lists with numbers or bullets. They help to organize data clearly. Also, they catch user’s eye so the information won’t get lost in the general body of text.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>9. Highlight the key information in the text</h3>\r\n<p>Good old bold, italics and color highlighting are old school but they still work successfully. This way you may attract attention to the significant idea, definition, quote or other type of specific data included right into the paragraph. What’s more, the clickable part of the text (links to other pages) must be visually marked. We are used to seeing them underlined, still highlighting them additionally with color or bolder font is even more effective.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>10. Use images and illustrations</h3>\r\n<p>In web user interface design, images are highly supportive in setting the mood or transferring the message. They are the content which is both informative and emotionally appealing. Original illustration, prominent hero banners, engaging photos can easily catch users’ attention and support the general stylistic concept. What’s more, they play a big role in building visual hierarchy and make the copy content more digestible in combination with illustrations or photos. People perceive images faster than words which is an important factor for increased scannability.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img src=\"https://tubikstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/financial_service_website_tubik.png\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Improving scannability of the webpages, designers and content creators show real respect to website users. This way we save users’ time and effort providing them with organized, harmonic, valuable and attractive content.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Useful Articles</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.uxmatters.com/mt/archives/2015/06/scannability-principle-and-practice.php\">Scannability: Principle and Practice</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-users-read-on-the-web/\">How Users Read on the Web</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://www.nngroup.com/articles/eyetracking-tasks-efficient-scanning/\">Scanning Patterns on the Web Are Optimized for the Current Task</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://tubikstudio.com/visual-hierarchy-effective-ui-content-organization/\">Visual Hierarchy: Effective UI Content Organization</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://tubikstudio.com/3c-of-interface-design-color-contrast-content/\">3C of Interface Design: Color, Contrast, Content</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://tubikstudio.com/gestalt-theory-for-ux-design-principle-of-proximity/\">Gestalt Theory for UX Design: Principle of Proximity</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://tubikstudio.com/gestalt-theory-for-efficient-ux-principle-of-similarity/\">Gestalt Theory for Efficient UX: Principle of Similarity</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"https://tubikstudio.com/negative-space-in-design-tips-and-best-practices/\">Negative Space in Design: Tips and Best Practices</a></li>\r\n</ul>', 'The article explains the factor of scannability, eye-tracking patterns and presents 10 tips for UX designers on enhancing scannability of web user interfaces', 'https://tubikstudio.com/ux-design-how-to-make-web-interface-scannable/', 'design', ''),
(14, 'Benek Lisefski', 'Designers who can code are more valuable', '1_jIJwzDv3t26povgiIjAo3Q.jpeg', '<p>Oh no. Here we go again. Another “should designers know how to code?” opinion. Hear me out, this one’s simple.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I’ve always believed?—?and have yet to hear a convincing argument against it?—?that UX/UI/interaction designers who can code are better designers. You need to understand the possibilities and constraints of your medium in order to do the best design work that technology can allow for. There’s no better way to gain this understanding than knowing how to build your own designs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(When I say coding, I refer to front-end code?—?HTML, CSS, and some Javascript. I wouldn’t expect most designers to dabble much in backend.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This may stem from the fact that I got into web design back in the days when CSS was barely a thing, most websites were static HTML pages, and layouts were coded in tables. Back then, if you wanted to publish anything on the web, you had to know how to built it yourself. There were no sophisticated online website builders, or specialist front-end devs on your team. It was just you, Photoshop, a text editor, and your free Geocities account. Boy, that was an exciting frontier.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So the concept of designing anything digital and interactive?—?without knowing how to build that experience?—?is very foreign to me. It’s like an architect not understanding building materials or basic engineering. Or a chef who plans menus but never cooks, tastes, and refines the completed dishes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some argue that you can <a href=\"https://medium.com/@MrAlanCooper/should-designers-code-f7b745b8cd03\">learn and empathise with the challenges coders face, without actually learning how to code</a>. <em><strong>But what the hell would be the point?</strong></em> Understanding the intricacies of those challenges without learning how to code would be more <em<difficult</em> than just learning how to code, so you understand those challenged from first-hand experience!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The value in being a modern designer who knows code isn’t only you can replace the job of a front-end dev. You may only have to produce production code on occasion for certain types of clients, but the point is that you know the ins and outs of it. It’s about understanding what developers are talking about so you can participate in discussions that cross between design and front-end.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Coding your own designs is also an extremely effective way to maintain quality control and attention to detail in design implementation?—?something that is easily lost in communication even between very skilled people with the best intentions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>But that’s not what I’m writing about today.</strong> I don’t care if you don’t believe knowing how to code makes you a better designer. There are more important reasons to consider.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>What provides clients the most value?</h2>\r\n<p>Coming from a freelance design perspective, I think a lot about what services create the most value for my clients. I’m often hired to do an array of jobs on a project, which may range from branding, info architecture and UX design, UI design, front-end code, CMS development, print design, and more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is in stark contrast to an in-house design position?—?especially at a larger agency or corporation?—?where there will be other specialists on your team to cover those roles, so you can focus on what you do best.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a freelance designer, you rarely have that luxury. Most clients don’t have the resources to coordinate an entire team of specialist freelancers. If they were to bother with that, they may as well hire a full-service agency. They need one or two dedicated, trustworthy people who can do it all for them. That means you have to wear many hats. <a href=\"https://uxdesign.cc/the-best-designers-are-business-strategists-a02ee6ec5db9\">You can’t be only a UI designer</a>, or just a front-end developer. That’s too narrow a range to offer substantial value. <a href=\"https://uxplanet.org/designers-kill-your-labels-af3a0034c8d5\">You need to be T-shaped</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Let’s look at a hypothetical project as an example</h3>\r\n<p>A small business is developing a new responsive web app. They already have a developer as part of their team, but they don’t have any design capabilities in-house. They realise the importance good design plays in the success of their app, but they don’t have enough ongoing design work to hire a full-time designer. So they look for an independent designer to steer the design part of their project and deliver what their developer needs to implement it accurately. This is a very common scenario in which I’ve been hired for a number of jobs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p?This project may be broken up into phases like this:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Info architecture</li>\r\n<li>UX design and wireframes + prototyping and testing</li>\r\n<li>UI design</li>\r\n<li>Front-end code</li>\r\n<li>Back-end development</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>This client has #5 taken care of internally, but they need help with 1–4. If you, as a designer, can’t supply that full range of services, they have to look for yet another freelancer or two to fill in the gaps. Chances are, that’s one hurdle too many for the client. They’ll pass on you and look for someone else who they can trust to see the project through from start to finish.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You just lost a design job because you don’t know front-end code. In that client’s eyes, you’re not well-rounded enough to take a gamble on. They need more value.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Here’s another example</h3>\r\n<p>The same client’s in-house dev has strong enough front-end skills cover both phases #4 and #5. You’re great at 1, 2 and 3, so you’ve landed the job. Congrats!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>UI design goes smoothly, and you package up all your files for hand-off to their developer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Weeks later, you start getting frustrated emails about how some of your design solutions are extremely costly in development. That slider you thought was simple is actually adding 8 hours to their dev schedule. They now have to either come back to you (and pay you more money) to revise designs for a different solution that’s easier to implement. Or even worse, the developer hacks together an alternative on her own with little design consideration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Had you known what was involved in coding that feature, all of this could have been avoided. You would have brought up the potential complication from your side when you first presented the design idea, initiating a conversation to see if they were comfortable with the development cost. Had it been a problem, it would have been caught early, and you could have provided an alternative solution on the next design iteration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But you didn’t, and you just cost your client a thousand dollars because of one poor design decision, stemming from your lack of front-end understanding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These examples may sound pedantic, but they’re not to your clients! And they are all too common.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Good designers vs. Great designers</h2>\r\n<p>The ease of relationship you provide?—?and the level of trust you earn by anticipating these challenges before they happen?—?is what separates average designers from great designers. And average <a href=\"https://medium.com/swlh/the-right-way-to-start-freelancing-5f95861dec0\">freelancers</a> from <a href=\"https://medium.com/swlh/are-you-working-for-cost-clients-or-value-clients-bc5a4f517ef2\">exceptional business partners</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Being able to consult across that full range of services makes you more valuable to your clients. It makes you more suitable for larger jobs. And it allows you to command higher rates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even if you’re a designer on a team of other specialists who together provide that full range of services, you’re far more valuable to your employer if you have the nous to understand and contribute to conversations around their parts of the project as well as yours. That’s how effective teams communicate. Nothing is done in a silo anymore, and everything overlaps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So the next time you get defensive about your lack of coding know-how, remember this: it’s not other designers or front-end coders you have to justify your limited design skillset to, it’s your clients. If you can’t provide everything they need to make their project (and your designs) as successful as possible, you’re losing jobs and losing opportunities for higher pay.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Forget about whether coding makes you a better designer. The added value it brings to your clients is more than enough reason to get on board with it. And it will produce the side effect of making you a stronger interaction designer, whether you want to believe it or not.</p>', 'I’ve always believed?—?and have yet to hear a convincing argument against it?—?that UX/UI/interaction designers who can code are better designers.
